  intro: |
    This package contains a subset of practice models from the Too Tall Tobby competition.
    The models are provided in the form of images, and PartCAD AI features are used
    to reconstruct the 3D models from the images.
    The models are not yet ejected from the initial AI configuration, so you
    can use your own AI API keys to tweak the input data as well as the prompts to
    regenerate the scripts.

    You can also easily change the PartCAD configuration
    to generate OpenSCAD or build123d scripts instead of CadQuery ones.
